This project is a lighter weight alternative to Dhaka, the previous iteration
of the UChicago Marketplace. It is specifically designed for long-term, zero
maintenance operation.

To run a server locally:

    $ dev_appserver.py .

If you want to upgrade the version of Flask:

    $ ./update_vendor.sh

To update the version currently running on App Engine, either push to this 
repository or run:

    $ appcfg.py --oauth2 update .
